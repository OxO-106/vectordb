[x] image embedding with CLIP (512)
[x] image entropy with color
[x] calculate average entropy for image
[x] calculate average entropy for texts
[x] calculate the ratio of the entropies to get the ground truth
    6.629007/4.150625 = 1.597349
[x] use PCA to reduce dimension from 512 -> 256 -> 128 -> 64
    [] calculate entropy and entropy ratio
[] calculate entropy with embeddings
