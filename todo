[x] image embedding with CLIP (512)
[x] image entropy with color
[x] calculate average entropy for image
[x] calculate average entropy for texts
[x] calculate the ratio of the entropies to get the ground truth
    6.629007/4.150625 = 1.597349
[x] use PCA to reduce dimension from 512 -> 256 -> 128 -> 64
    [x] calculate entropy and entropy ratio
[x] calculate entropy with embeddings

[x] reduce dimension to 32, 16 and 50
    [x] calculate entropy
    [] is the pattern still there
[] image dimension kept unchanged, text dimension reduce to 50
[] (alternative approach) dimension ratio 1.6:1 reduce text dimension
[] calculate precision at k
